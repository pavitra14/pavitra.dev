## Automating Mouse Cursor

**_Disclaimer: I'm writing this post just for educational purposes and I do not support Time Theft. I think automation is pretty cool so that's why I make such stuff._**

We're gonna use the library _pyautogui_ to automate our cursor.

So let's start!

## Installing the pyautogui Module

The `pyautogui` module can send virtual keypresses and mouse clicks to Windows, OS X, and Linux. Depending on which operating system you’re using, you may have to install some other modules (called _dependencies_) before you can install PyAutoGUI.

- On Windows, there are no other modules to install.
- On OS X, run **`sudo pip3 install pyobjc-framework-Quartz`**, **`sudo pip3 install pyobjc-core`**, and then **`sudo pip3 install pyobjc`**.
- On Linux, run **`sudo pip3 install python3-xlib`**, **`sudo apt-get install scrot`**, **`sudo apt-get install python3-tk`**, and **`sudo apt-get install python3-dev`**. (Scrot is a screenshot program that PyAutoGUI uses.)

After these dependencies are installed, run **`pip install pyautogui`** (or **`pip3`** on OS X and Linux) to install PyAutoGUI.

Before we start our script, we need to make sure it doesn't get out of control and you don't have to deal with such issues.
So We'll be using some fail safes.

```python
import pyautogui
pyautogui.PAUSE = 1
pyautogui.FAILSAFE = True
```

Here we import `pyautogui` and set `pyautogui.PAUSE` to `1` for a one-second pause after each function call. We set `pyautogui.FAILSAFE` to `True` to enable the fail-safe feature.

## Controlling Mouse Movement

![Ref: Automate the Boring Stuff - Screen Coordinates](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/images/000011.jpg)

Your _resolution_ is how many pixels wide and tall your screen is. If your screen’s resolution is set to 1920×1080, then the coordinate for the upper-left corner will be (0, 0), and the coordinate for the bottom-right corner will be (1919, 1079).

The `pyautogui.size()` function returns a two-integer tuple of the screen’s width and height in pixels. Enter the following into the interactive shell:

```python
import pyautogui
pyautogui.size()
(1920, 1080)
width, height = pyautogui.size()
```

## That's enough for basics.

Let's write our code.

#### Include the dependencies

```python
import pyautogui
from time import sleep
from random import randint
```

#### Globals and failsafes

```python
pyautogui.PAUSE = 1.5
pyautogui.FAILSAGE = True
screen_width , screen_height = pyautogui.size()
```

#### Function to get the next random position for your mouse cursor.

```python
def getNextPos():
    x = randint(0, screen_width - 1)
    y = randint(0, screen_height -1)
    return x , y
```

#### Function to move the mouse cursor and sleep for 1 second.

```python
def move():
    x,y = getNextPos()
    print("Moving to ({},{})".format(x,y))
    pyautogui.moveTo(x,y, duration=0.25)
    sleep(1)
```

#### Finally, the entry point

```python
print("Press CTRL-C to Stop")
while True:
    move()
```

### Complete code looks like this

```python
import pyautogui
from time import sleep
from random import randint


pyautogui.PAUSE = 1.5
pyautogui.FAILSAGE = True
screen_width , screen_height = pyautogui.size()

def getNextPos():
    x = randint(0, screen_width - 1)
    y = randint(0, screen_height -1)
    return x , y

def move():
    x,y = getNextPos()
    print("Moving to ({},{})".format(x,y))
    pyautogui.moveTo(x,y, duration=0.25)
    sleep(1)

print("Press CTRL-C to Stop")
while True:
    move()
```

#### Run it using

```bash
python automate.py
```
