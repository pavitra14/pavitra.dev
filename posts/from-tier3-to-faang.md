![With a great JEE score, comes a great headache](https://i.imgflip.com/61d0hh.jpg)

Frankly speaking, I never was any good at JEE. I scored an awesome score of **31/360** and I'm very proud of it. This image may offend alot of people but I have no regrets.

*Note : This is more of a personal blog than a preparation guide.*

### Preface (or most likely an intro on what to expect out of this)

> This is a caffiene fueled article and I'm pretty sure nothing is gonna make sense but still why not do it.

I did waste 2 years of my life going to JEE preparation institutes like most science students in the country but I was lucky enough to realise 2 days before my JEE that I cannot follow the rat race of just getting a good score and getting any branch just for the sake of the college name. 

Ironically, It doesn't matter which college you're from or what your score in the above said exam is, it all depends on your own perseverance and determination (and also having atleast a normal functioning brain, also known as common sense).

I actually started to write this blog on 6th September 2021 but I'm not sure when (or ever) it'll be complete. That simply put, is how adult life is, sadly. Alot of students and juniors and linkedin connections reached out to me to share my interview experience, what I believe is getting a good job is much more than just an interview experience, it's a whole journey of preparation and experiences throughout a candidate's life which helps him. So sorry for the cliche if you're here just for the interview preparation guide or the experience or just asking the questions that were asked (Which I anyway cannot reveal for legal reasons).

I mostly intend to cover my journey from being a small town college student to an engineer in a FAANG.I'll try to cover as much things as I can, since my time is limited I may skip over a few things but feel free to reach out on LinkedIn.

### School Life (and does it really matter?)

I was never really a very good academic (or social for that matter) student in school, if you ask anyone from my school batch you'll only here one thing, that "Oh yeah there was a guy but he never used to talk to anyone and just lurks in the corner.". That's entirely true tbh. I never was a very active student, used to spend most of my time in computer labs and just wreaking havoc there. I always just wanted to do what I enjoyed, thus I started out quite early. At first, I was fascinated by all electronics and used to play around with alot of circuits (needless to say, I got shocked alot), It was around 5th Standard that Internet intrigued me. I started studying html and web basics using borrowed books at that time. We had a 128kbps BSNL connection and god knows how fast it was. Two years I tried to do basic web dev then started out with PHP in 7th standard and was freelenacing by 8th.

I had no knowledge of what data structures are, what control structures are and all the mumbo jumbo. All I knew was if I write this I'll get the output, so you can say that was mostly street knowledge. But still, I believe freelancing gives you alot of necessary exposure and experience on how software is written. I freelanced for a couple of years before being forced to drop it all because of 10+2 constraints. I lost all practice and touch for 2 years. 

Fast forward to JEE, a day before the actual exam I decided `Nahi ho payega` and just screwed the paper intentionally. Ironically, I calculated getting 18/360 using the answer keys available online, but when the actual result came, i scored 31/360 and trust me I was soo happy that I even got that score, considering how I botched the exam. Looking back right now, I have absolutely no regrets on my decisions and my score. It's just a proof that JEE cannot decide your future, it's merely a tool for manipulating students to run the rat race. I've known non science people also getting great tech jobs, so yeah, this all does not matter. Be it a Ivy League expensive af school or a moderate or a state governed school, it has no role to play in what you can and cannot do in life. It's your environment that shapes you. The people around you contribute alot in shaping your personality, so make sure you surround yourself with the right crowd.

### Choice of College (and was it a right decision?)

Ironically, I chose a Tier 3 / Private College in my hometown on purpose. I had a good score in my 10+2 Board exams (I still don't know how it happened) so I got offers from many prestigious Private universities with scholarships. The catch with them is that the scholarship is only for the first year, you still have to spend lakhs of rupees for rest 3 years unless you plan to drop out (Lol, like Indian Parents would actually support that). So I thought why to spend literally millions of rupees on a college when the oppurtunities at the end of degree are gonna be the same  regardless of college. So I just went ahead and decided to join a college in my home town. Easy commute and I saved literally a ton of money on alot of facilities.

During my admission time, Alot of my relatives tried to sway my parents that I'm ruining my future by choosing a same city private college, ironically they stopped calling when I got placed :v . Even my parents were conscious of my decision but they had no option but to support me (31/360 did help me here). Somewhere I also knew that it's gonna be difficult but I was like `Dekha jayega`

I have no regrets in any decisions I made. My College turned out to be one of the best decisions I ever made. The faculty immediately understood my needs and potential and they supported my throughout my college period. I had the best class incharge and head of department in terms support. Frankly, I wouldn't be where I am right now if I chose any other college. Being a private college in my own city, gave me alot of times to work on my skills and explore more things. I met a bunch of interesting people (they know who they are), got into alot of trouble, both in personal life (That's right dear, I made it, on my own if I may add) as well as academically (Well, attendance and I never really was in any classes). But it is like what they say, You got through a major personality change in college, and it only makes you a better human being. 

### Being an average student (and getting a dream job)

![It's not as easy as it seems](https://i.imgflip.com/5skytc.jpg)

(If only it was that easy, but seriously, I don't understand how *Mitochondria is the power house of the cell* ever helped me)

For an average student, It's not easy. You have to cover alot of ground. I only had a GPA of 8.6, that too the pandemic had a major role in that. 

#### first year

It was probably the best time throughout my college journey, I met a whole new company of people, made alot of friends, saw how the world works, I experienced that type of independence for the first time. I did nothing but enjoy in my first year, and also a small 15 day internship with VidTold. It was not a tech internship but more of a multimedia thing. I was working on animation and video editing. At that stage, I was still figuring out what I want to do as a career so was just exploring things.

#### second year

Ah, this year was one which made me realise in how much water I am in. I led my first team in Grand Finale of Smart India Hackathon 2019 in Pune. We had a great product and pitch deck but a small tech glitch in my laptop config (idk why my ubuntu settings stopped responding) 10mins before the finale pitch ruined it all. We had a somewhat a great team and we enjoyed alot but still, i regret losing that. After coming out of that thing, I did participate in Codevita that year, only to fail very very badly. That's when I realised I did not know anything at all! I couldnt solve even the easiest question there is. I took that failure quite hard and started studying DSA religiously. I also started as a Backend Developer Intern at Recooty, which ultimately made me grow as a developer and taught me alot on how to scale and how shitty my code was before that.

#### third year 

Thanks to last years' experience, I cracked Codevita open this time, purely as revenge! Seriously though, studying DSA religiously helped me alot. I was also a finalist in Smart India Hackathon 2019 with one of the best team (They know who they are) I have ever worked with. Even though we lost, that was an experience of a lifetime for me. I cracked HackwithInfy, Codevita and couple more such competitions and got a Pre placement Interview and offers from that. So yes, DSA!!!!!!! I also participated in TCS Inframind which led to get an internship in TCS, which gave me a direct Interview and a TCS Digital Offer (7L CTC was the highest for our college). I worked on alot of projects, on wayyy diverse domains, just to expand my knowledge. I developed a student tracking system as my main project, the whole aim was to find out which student is bunking where in the campus. I still remember the praise it got from the faculty and the backlash from the students :v.

#### fourth year

This year was mostly dedicated to placements. Like every other college, we're only allowed to sit for one company in one salary bracket. First company to visit our campus was Reliance Jio at 3.5L CTC, ironically it wasn't even a proper drive, all they had was an assessment which even school students can solve and for interviews they just asked what is testing and average interview lasted for 5mins. I cracked that easily, though it wasn't a challenge at all. Second compant was Persistent Systems, of which I cleared all the rounds, including the advanced coding rounds, only to be offered 4.5L CTC. Third Company was Infosys where I was offered 5L CTC, that was off campus because I cleared HackwithInfy rounds. Fourth company was TCS with a Digital Offer of 7L CTC (Thanks to Inframind). I was happy with the Digital offer because that's what I thought was the most I could get. Luckily, Thanks to Cisco Ideathon, I bagged the highest package in my college, of approx 18L CTC. You can read more about it *<u>[here](https://pbehre.in/posts/cisco-ideathon-2020-journey)</u>*.

I joined Cisco Systems as a Software Engineer (Intern + Full Time) in my final year. That pretty much sums my college life. On a personal front, I dealt with depression and brain fog alot during the last semester and final months of college. 

Back then, getting Cisco was the dream because I honestly did not hope to get anything more.

### Getting an offer from Amazon (the actual dream job)

I applied to Amazon in Feb 21, when I was still an Intern with Cisco. I had a habit of applying to atleast 20 jobs in a week, because of the notion that *You apply to 100, you get response from 1* . Following that only, I applied to Amazon in Feb and got a link for Online Assessment. I did good in that, atleast I assumed I did. They never tell you the results and it's not like I was expecting anything because I was out of practice.

First step to get in was the Resume Shortlisting and the Online Assessment. They're both pretty self explanatory, and I actually consider these two the most difficult parts.

6 months later, around in july I got an interview call from Amazon. They informed me 3 days before the interview. So it was only natural that I panic because I have no idea how to prepare for interviews or what they'll ask. Luckily, a good friend came to my rescue and helped me prepare. She also cracked Amazon just a few months before so she was a major help.

Companies like Amazon majorly focus on your core Data Structures and Algorithmic Skills. They also pay deep attention to your behavorial traits, which they term it as leadership principles. Everything a person do can tell you alot about their traits. Amazon Interview Process is different than most other companies and is one of the most interesting interview experience I've had. They assess the best qualities in you in an unique way.

There are usually four rounds:

- DSA and Algo Round

  They Focus on your dsa abilities via a coding questions

- Coding Round

  They focus on on your coding abilities. You're given a live code link to their internal tool where you have to solve a question live, without any IDE help. They judge your logic forming abilities and how you can Deliver Results and Earn trust of your interviewer. 

  They also ask a bunch of behaviourial questions to judge your abilities to perform in a corporate setting.

  First Two rounds are often mixed together. So Just take it like first two are your skill and abilities test.

- Hiring Manager Round

  Here you meet your hiring manager and discuss on the prospects of the project and your prior experience and how it may compliment your new job if you get it. They majorly focus on leadership principles and how you were able to solve complex problems in your past experiences.

- Bar Raiser

  This is probably the most important part of any process. At Amazon, Every new hire has to raise the bar. That is, You have to be better than 50% of all the existing employees at that role to be hired. Raising the bar in Amazon is very crucial and they take it very seriously, that's how they Make sure they hire the best talent there is. Along with raising the bar, they also judge you on how you can growth over the years in your role. These two factors are very important in your final hiring decision.

***Amazon asks the candidates to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement so I will be respecting that and I won't be sharing any crucial information or questions or names of any personnel involved.***



## TL;DR

There is no formula to crack PBC / FAANG / MAANG companies. There is no shortcut to do that. If you're looking for a formala that says

> FAANG Interviews can be cracked in 'x' amount of preparation days

You couldn't be more wrong. There are many who prepare for months before an interview and still don't clear it. The main reason behind that is even you prepared for 'x' months, you cannot become exceptional just from preparing, you need to have that passion, you need to have that **PRACTICE** over the years. FAANG only hires exceptional talent, you cannot become exceptional just be months of preparation, you need to have that personality of solving problems and innovating. You need to have a lifestyle where your curiosity drives you and you develop excellent problem solving capabilities. For those who have '**it**', nothing is difficult. For those you don't and are in Tier 3, Sorry to burst your bubble, but...

I got offered **Software Development Engineer - I** at **Amazon India**, that may not be a big feat for most but for someone who's in a same city tier 2/3 private college, this is something more than you can ever imagine. Surely it was not easy at all. Infact easy is not the term I would use anywhere in this blog.
