I think automation is pretty cool so that's why I make such stuff.</strong></em></p>\n<p>We're gonna use the library <em>pyautogui</em> to automate our cursor.</p>\n<p>So let's start!</p>\n<h2>Installing the pyautogui Module</h2>\n<p>The <code>pyautogui</code> module can send virtual keypresses and mouse clicks to Windows, OS X, and Linux. Depending on which operating system you’re using, you may have to install some other modules (called <em>dependencies</em>) before you can install PyAutoGUI.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On Windows, there are no other modules to install.</li>\n<li>On OS X, run <strong><code>sudo pip3 install pyobjc-framework-Quartz</code></strong>, <strong><code>sudo pip3 install pyobjc-core</code></strong>, and then <strong><code>sudo pip3 install pyobjc</code></strong>.</li>\n<li>On Linux, run <strong><code>sudo pip3 install python3-xlib</code></strong>, <strong><code>sudo apt-get install scrot</code></strong>, <strong><code>sudo apt-get install python3-tk</code></strong>, and <strong><code>sudo apt-get install python3-dev</code></strong>. (Scrot is a screenshot program that PyAutoGUI uses.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After these dependencies are installed, run <strong><code>pip install pyautogui</code></strong> (or <strong><code>pip3</code></strong> on OS X and Linux) to install PyAutoGUI.</p>\n<p>Before we start our script, we need to make sure it doesn't get out of control and you don't have to deal with such issues.\nSo We'll be using some fail safes.</p>\n<div class=\"remark-highlight\"><pre class=\"language-python\"><code class=\"language-python\"><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> pyautogui\npyautogui<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>PAUSE <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span>\npyautogui<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>FAILSAFE <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">True</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Here we import <code>pyautogui</code> and set <code>pyautogui.PAUSE</code> to <code>1</code> for a one-second pause after each function call.

Currently it's only available to registered <a href=\"https://www.netacad.com\">Cisco Networking Academies</a>.</p>\n<p>The Cisco Ideathon is an opportunity for students with potential and creativity to be a part of Cisco’s technological innovations. In simpler words, Cisco Ideathon is a great opportunity for students from non-Ivy league universities to showcase their skill and expertise, and get a chance to get shortlisted and Intern at one of the biggest IT Companies in the world.</p>\n<p>Did you know that after San Jose, CA, Cisco has there biggest development center in Bangalore, India. Via Ideathon, You may get a chance to work there.</p>\n<h1>How to clear Cisco Ideathon?</h1>\n<p>I would be lying if I said clearing Ideathon is easy. It's not! But don't let that bring you down, No matter the difficulty level, it's surely fun to participate and learn. I haven't learned at this pace in whole my university period than in these 3 months of competition duration.</p>\n<p>You need dedication, determination and a whole lot of caffeine☕ to go through this, but I can assure you it's the event of a lifetime.</p>\n<p>So buckle up, you're in for a ride!</p>\n<h2>Prerequisites:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Enrolled in Cisco NetAcad</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Good DSA and Domain Knowledge</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>NetAcad Course Certifications (Not just copy paste, You should be well versed in it too😏):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>CCNAv7: Introduction to Network</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>CCNAv7: Switching, Routing &#x26; Wireless Essentials</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Networking Essentials</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Get Connected</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>PCAP: Programming with Python</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>C/C++ Equivalent Course.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Not all courses are mandatory but it's highly recommended that you do them all</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Coding Skills (Duh!)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Internet Connection 😐</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/rSKdjTH.png\" alt=\"Contest Journey\"></p>\n<h2>How to prepare?</h2>\n<p>Alot of people ask me this question on a daily basis, so I planned to write this blog, One time hassle only😂. There's alot of ways you can prepare. Some people prefer tutors, some prefer books, some prefer YouTube and some hand written notes.\nI'm more of a hand written and Youtube kinda person.</p>\n<p>I'm not much of a reader, be it books or any course content, I prefer practical approaches more than just theory (not just in this case but everywhere). When it comes to notes, I prefer writing my own in my own way so I can understand them better and they later serve as a revision copy as well. CCNA is VAAAAST, so if you're planning to go for CCNA from youtube, there's a very high chance that you'll end up just getting confused and distracted. My suggestion and what I did was: Go through the NetAcad Course Content first, then use the topic headings and concepts from netacad, individually watch videos on them from YouTube (any youtube channel will work as long as you are getting it in) and simultaneously take notes. <strong>TAKE NOTES!</strong> I can't stress this enough. You cannot learn networking just by watching videos and reading content, you need to make sure you are absorbing all the details and getting enough hands on practice. The ratio should by 1:1 for Studying:Practicing.</p>\n<p>The perfect tool for practicing networking concepts is by using Cisco Packet Tracer, another just awesome tool made available to NetAcad enrolled students. Create, Simulate, Observe. These 3 steps are most important in learning networking.</p>\n<p>Also, don't just give all your time into just networking, give enough time to other subjects as well, DSA, Operating Systems, DBMS, Internet &#x26; Web Technologies, Cyber Security, Object Oriented Programming, C/C++, Python, Java etc.</p>\n<h3>Registration</h3>\n<p>Registration usually starts by 3rd week of August every year, your netacad instructor will inform you about that asap.</p>\n<h3>Round 1: Quiz (Knockout round)</h3>\n<p>Probably one of the most important round, as major shortlisting is done here. You get 26 questions based on Dry Run Codes, CCNA, OS, DBMS, IWT, Cyber Security and some networking problems which you'll need to solve. It's a proctored examination so you gotta do it alone. If you made it through this round, Other rounds are fairly easy and less competetive.</p>\n<h3>Round 2A: Video Submission (Knockout round)</h3>\n<p>This is the round where you'll see the spirit of Ideathon. Also known as the \"<em>Ideation</em>\" round. You're given three problem statements, each one completely different from the other and unique in their own way. You're required to Analyse, Research and Come up with a solution for any one of them using 5G or any other latest technologies. Your solution should be unique, innovative, scalable and feasible to implement. Here's the catch, you only have <strong>90 seconds</strong> to do all that! Not one second less, Not one second more. Exact 90seconds. It should be well shot, well edited, well rendered and should contain enough research to make your solution viable. You get approximately 4-6 days to complete everything and upload. Always upload atleast a day before the deadline to avoid any issues.</p>\n<p><em>I'm not sure if we're allowed to share our videos, but will update this in future if any update is there.</em></p>\n<h3>Round 2B: Competency Assessment Test (Not a Knockout round)</h3>\n<p>As the name suggests, this assessment is to evaluate your competency in a high pressured work environment. Contains general aptitude and pyschological questions</p>\n<h3>Round 3: UR Test (Knockout round)</h3>\n<p>UR stands for University Recruitment. Thus, if you made it till here, Congratulations, you've cleared Ideathon and now you're on the track for University Recruitment. The path only gets more and more difficult from here on. You need to clear this test to proceed to the interviews. UR Test contains 26 questions, were 25 are MCQs from DSA, DBMS, CCNA, Cyber Security and other domain subjects and 1 competetive coding question. Before attempting the UR Test, they ask you to fill your preference for Job roles. In Ideathon 2020, there were Software Engineer - Engineering, Software Engineer - IT, Consulting Engineer - CX, Business Analyst and Site Reliability Engineer roles. Based on your performance in this test, you'll be given the roles. It's like an unsaid thing but if you want the SE roles, <strong>SOLVE THE CODING QUESTION</strong></p>\n<h3>Round 4: Technical Interview (Knockout round)</h3>\n<p>As the name suggests, You're called for a Technical Interview, which can be virtual or on-site, depends on the situations. A panel of three will conduct that and will ask you questions based on your resume and role. Make sure to prepare well and answer confidently.</p>\n<h3>Round 5: Managerial Interview (Knockout round)</h3>\n<p>They'll ask you questions and some situations, how you will handle them and how can you improve them. You answer should be original as the interview is alot more experienced than you are, thus they know when you're saying the words from the internet. Be original, Be Confident</p>\n<h3>Round 6: HR Interview (Knockout round)</h3>\n<p>Do not believe in hearsay that you cannot get rejected in HR round! This round is as important as any other. They check your communication skills, confidence and your ability to handle things. You'll be told your offer CTC in this round so listen carefully too!</p>\n<h3>There's no Round 7</h3>\n<p>You're done and in a few days you'll get your result. Congratulations and all the best!</p>\n<p>At the time of writing this article, I'm currently a Software Engineer Intern @ Cisco System (India) Pvt. Ltd. See you there.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ieNZBMg.jpg\" alt=\"Cisco Day One\" style=\"zoom:50%;\" />\n<h5>References:</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.netacad.com\">NetAcad</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2D1o-aM-2s&#x26;list=PLh94XVT4dq02frQRRZBHzvj2hwuhzSByN\">Full Series | 200-301 CCNA | Free Cisco Video Training 2020 | Networking Inc.</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2_aWCzGMAwI3W_JlcBbtYTwiQSsOTa6P\">Data Structures</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n","title":"My Cisco Ideathon 2020 Journey","date":"2021-03-28","excerpt":"How I prepared for Cisco Ideathon 2020 and How to prepare for Ideathon 2021"},"coding-exercise-tictactoe":{"id":"coding-exercise-tictactoe","contentHtml":"<h2>TicTacToe - Coding Exercise for Beginners</h2>\n<p>Who doesn't love a litle tictactoe on the back of their notebooks during class/lectures.

I scored an awesome score of <strong>31/360</strong> and I'm very proud of it. This image may offend a lot of people, but I have no regrets.</p>\n<p><em>Note : This is more of a personal blog than a preparation guide.</em></p>\n<h3>Preface (or most likely an intro on what to expect out of this)</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is a caffeine-fueled article not sure if anything will make sense but still worth it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So after wasting 2 years of my life going to JEE preparation institutes like every average science student in India, I realize, 2 days prior to my exam that I cannot follow the rat race of scoring JEE and settle for a course for the sake of college.</p>\n<p>Ironically, It doesn't matter which college you're from or what you score in exams, your perseverance and determination are all that matters. (also possessing a normal functioning brain, AKA, common sense).</p>\n<p>I started writing this blog on 6th September 2021, not knowing when it’ll actually end and sadly conclude adult life. A lot of people reached out to me to share my interview experience and I personally believe getting a good job is much more than just an interview experience. It's a whole journey of preparation and experiences throughout a candidate's life that contributes to this.</p>\n<p>This blog is dedicated to covering my journey from being a small-town college student to an engineer in a FAANG. Though trying to cover everything I can, I may skip over a few things but feel free to reach out on LinkedIn.</p>\n<h3>School Life (and does it really matter?)</h3>\n<p>Never really the most academic or social student in school, I was the shy kid that got bullied a lot (Ironically, the ones who used to bully me, now come to me for career advice!) . I used to spend most of my time in computer labs and just wreaking havoc there. Wanting to do something I enjoyed, I started out quite early. At first, I was fascinated by all electronics and used to play around with a lot of circuits (needless to say, I got shocked a lot). It was around the 5th standard when the Internet intrigued me.</p>\n<p>I started studying Html and web basics using borrowed books at that time. We had a 128kbps BSNL connection and god knows how fast it was. For two years I tried to do basic web dev then started out with PHP in 7th standard and was freelancing by 8th.</p>\n<p>I had no knowledge of what data structures are, what control structures are, and all the mumbo jumbo. All I knew was if I write this I'll get the output, so you can say that was mostly street knowledge. I believe freelancing gives you a lot of necessary exposure and experience on how software is written. I freelanced for a couple of years before being forced to drop it all because of 10+2 constraints. I lost all practice and touch for 2 years.</p>\n<p>Fast-forward to JEE, a day before the actual exam I decide, it's not my cup of tea and just screwed the paper intentionally (Let's go with that, please). I calculated getting 18/360 and ended up scoring 31/360. Considering how badly I botched the exam, I was on cloud nine with no regrets! Let the record show that no exam can decide your future. It's your environment that shapes you, people around you contribute a lot to shaping your personality, so make sure you surround yourself with the right crowd.</p>\n<h3>Choice of College (and was it a right decision?)</h3>\n<p>Ironically, I chose a Tier 3 / Private College in my hometown on purpose. I had a good score in my 10+2 Board exams (I still don't know how it happened) so I got offers from many prestigious Private universities with scholarships. The catch with them is that the scholarship is only for the first year, you still have to spend lakhs of rupees for rest 3 years unless you plan to drop out (Lol, like Indian Parents would actually support that). So I thought why to spend literally millions of rupees on a college when the opportunities at the end of degree are going to be the same regardless of college. So I just went ahead and decided to join a college in my hometown. Easy commute and I saved literally a ton of money on a lot of facilities.</p>\n<p>During my admission time, A lot of my relatives tried to sway my parents that I'm ruining my future by choosing a same city private college, ironically they stopped calling when I got placed :v. Even my parents were conscious of my decision, but they had no option but to support me (31/360 did help me here). Somewhere I also knew that it's going to be difficult, but I was like <code>Dekha jayega</code></p>\n<p>I have no regrets in any decisions I made. My College turned out to be one of the best decisions I ever made. The faculty immediately understood my needs and potential, and they supported my throughout my college period. I had the best class in charge and head of department in terms support. Frankly, I wouldn't be where I am right now if I chose any other college. Being a private college in my own city, gave me a lot of times to work on my skills and explore more things. I met a bunch of interesting people (they know who they are), got into a lot of trouble, both in personal life (That's right dear, I made it, on my own if I may add) and academically (Well, attendance and I never really was in any classes). But it is like what they say, You got through a major personality change in college, and it only makes you a better human being.</p>\n<h3>Being an average student (and getting a dream job)</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgflip.com/5skytc.jpg\" alt=\"It&#x27;s not as easy as it seems\"></p>\n<p>(If only it was that easy, but seriously, I don't understand how <em>Mitochondria is the power house of the cell</em> ever helped me)</p>\n<p>For an average student, It's not easy. You have to cover a lot of ground. I only had a GPA of 8.6, that to the pandemic had a major role in that.</p>\n<h4>first year</h4>\n<p>It was probably the best time throughout my college journey, I met a whole new company of people, made a lot of friends, saw how the world works, experienced that type of independence for the first time. I did nothing but enjoy in my first year, and also a small 15-day internship with VidTold. It was not a tech internship but more of a multimedia thing. I was working on animation and video editing. At that stage, I was still figuring out what I want to do as a career so was just exploring things.</p>\n<h4>second year</h4>\n<p>Ah, this year was one which made me realize in how much water I am in. I led my first team in Grand Finale of Smart India Hackathon 2019 in Pune. We had a great product and pitch deck but a small tech glitch in my laptop config (I don't know why my ubuntu settings stopped responding) 10 mins before the finale pitch ruined it all. We had a somewhat great team, and we enjoyed a lot but still, I regret losing that. After coming out of that thing, I did participate in Codevita that year, only to fail very very badly. That's when I realized I did not know anything at all! I couldn't solve even the easiest question there is. I took that failure quite hard and started studying DSA religiously. I also started as a Backend Developer Intern at Recooty, which ultimately made me grow as a developer and taught me a lot on how to scale and how shitty my code was before that.</p>\n<h4>third year</h4>\n<p>Thanks to last years' experience, I cracked Codevita open this time, purely as revenge! Seriously though, studying DSA religiously helped me a lot. I was also a finalist in Smart India Hackathon 2019 with one of the best team (They know who they are) I have ever worked with. Even though we lost, that was an experience of a lifetime for me. I cracked HackwithInfy, Codevita and couple more such competitions and got a Pre placement Interview and offers from that. So yes, DSA!!!!!!! I also participated in TCS Inframind which helped to get an internship, which gave me a direct Interview and an offer (7L CTC was the highest for our college). I worked on a lot of projects, on wayyy diverse domains, just to expand my knowledge. I developed a student tracking system as my main project, the whole aim was to find out which student is bunking where in the campus. I still remember the praise it got from the faculty and the backlash from the students :v.</p>\n<h4>fourth year</h4>\n<p>This year was mostly dedicated to placements. Like every other college, we're only allowed to sit for one company in one salary bracket. First company to visit our campus was Reliance Jio at 3.5L CTC, ironically it wasn't even a proper drive, all they had was an assessment which even school students can solve and for interviews they just asked what is testing, and average interview lasted for 5 mins. I cracked that easily, though it wasn't a challenge at all. Second company was Persistent Systems, of which I cleared all the rounds, including the advanced coding rounds, only to be offered 4.5L CTC. Third Company was Infosys where I was offered 5L CTC, that was off campus because I cleared HackwithInfy rounds. Fourth company was TCS with a Digital Offer of 7L CTC (Thanks to Inframind). I was happy with the Digital offer because that's what I thought was the most I could get. Luckily, Thanks to Cisco Ideathon, I bagged the highest package in my college, of approx 18L CTC. You can read more about it <em><u><a href=\"https://pbehre.in/posts/cisco-ideathon-2020-journey\">here</a></u></em>.</p>\n<p>I joined Cisco Systems as a Software Engineer (Intern + Full Time) in my final year. That pretty much sums my college life. On a personal front, I dealt with depression and brain fog a lot during the last semester and final months of college.</p>\n<p>Back then, getting Cisco was the dream because I honestly did not hope to get anything more.</p>\n<h3>Getting an offer from Amazon (the actual dream job)</h3>\n<img src=\"https://purepng.com/public/uploads/large/amazon-logo-s3f.png\" style=\"zoom:10%;\" />\n<p>I applied to Amazon in Feb 21, when I was still an Intern with Cisco. I had a habit of applying to at least 20 jobs in a week, because of the notion that <em>You apply to 100, you get response from 1</em>. Following that only, I applied to Amazon in Feb and got a link for Online Assessment. I did good in that, at least I assumed I did. They never tell you the results, and it's not like I was expecting anything because I was out of practice.</p>\n<p>First step to get in was the Resume Shortlisting and the Online Assessment. They're both pretty self-explanatory, and I actually consider these two the most difficult parts.</p>\n<p>6 months later, around in July I got an interview call from Amazon. They informed me 3 days before the interview. So it was only natural that I panic because I have no idea how to prepare for interviews or what they'll ask. Luckily, a good friend came to my rescue and helped me prepare.</p>\n<p>Companies like Amazon majorly focus on your core Data Structures and Algorithmic Skills. They also pay deep attention to your behavioral traits, which they term it as leadership principles. Everything a person do can tell you a lot about their traits. Amazon Interview Process is different from most other companies and is one of the most interesting interview experience I've had. They assess the best qualities in you uniquely.</p>\n<p>There are usually four rounds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>DSA and Algo Round</p>\n<p>​\tThey Focus on your dsa abilities via a coding questions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Coding Round</p>\n<p>They focus on your coding abilities. You're given a live code link to their internal tool where you have to solve a question live, without any IDE help. They judge your logic forming abilities and how you can Deliver Results and Earn trust of your interviewer.</p>\n<p>They also ask a bunch of behavioral questions to judge your abilities to perform in a corporate setting.</p>\n<p>First Two rounds are often mixed together. So Just take it like first two are your skill and abilities test.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hiring Manager Round</p>\n<p>Here you meet your hiring manager and discuss on the prospects of the project and your prior experience and how it may compliment your new job if you get it. They majorly pay attention to leadership principles and how you were able to solve complex problems in your experiences.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bar Raiser</p>\n<p>This is probably the most important part of any process. At Amazon, Every new hire has to raise the bar. That is, You have to be better than 50% of all the existing employees at that role to be hired. Raising the bar in Amazon is very crucial, and they take it very seriously, that's how they Make sure they hire the best talent there is. Along with raising the bar, they also judge you on how you can growth over the years in your role. These two factors are very influential in your final hiring decision.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>Amazon asks the candidates to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement, so I will be respecting that, and I won't be sharing any crucial information or questions or names of any personnel involved.</strong></em></p>\n<h2>TL;DR</h2>\n<p>There is no formula to crack PBC / FAANG / MAANG companies. There is no shortcut to do that. If you're looking for a formula that says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>FAANG Interviews can be cracked in 'x' amount of preparation days</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You couldn't be more wrong. There are many who prepare for months before an interview and still don't clear it. The main reason behind that is even you prepared for 'x' months, you cannot become exceptional just from preparing, you need to have that passion, you need to have that <strong>PRACTICE</strong> over the years. FAANG only hires exceptional talent, you cannot become exceptional just be months of preparation, you need to have that personality of solving problems and innovating. You need to have a lifestyle where your curiosity drives you and you develop excellent problem solving capabilities. For those who have '<strong>it</strong>', nothing is difficult. For those you don't and are in Tier 3, Sorry to burst your bubble, but...</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/lmPYglh.png\" alt=\"No Shortcuts\"></p>\n<p>I got offered <strong>Software Development Engineer - I</strong> at <strong>Amazon India</strong>, that may not be a big feat for most but for someone who's in a same city tier 2/3 private college, this is something more than you can ever imagine.

It is based on extending the conventional local procedure calling so that the <strong>called procedure need not exist in the same address space as the calling procedure</strong>.</p>\n<h1>What is gRPC?</h1>\n<img src=\"https://grpc.io/img/landing-2.svg\" alt=\"gRPC Architecture\" />\n<p>gRPC is a modern open source high performance RPC framework developed by Google and Introduced in 2015 that can run in any environment and communicate to any service in any supported language. It used by many major Internet Companies such as Google, Netflix, Cisco, CoreOS, Juniper etc.</p>\n<p>gRPC uses <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers\">Protocol Buffers</a> as it's Interface Definition Language.</p>\n<h1>Let's get started!</h1>\n<p>I came upon a problem in my work where I was required to use gRPC with Scala. Being a Software Developer, I knew how to do it in Java very well, but for some engineering reasons I was asked to write the same in Scala. Scala being a JVM language makes it very easy to write very efficient code in a very short footprint. The work that takes 500 lines of code in Java can be done easily in &#x3C;100 lines in Scala. Due to lack of documentation from ScalaPB on Streaming Calls, I decided to write my on article on this.</p>\n<h2>Prerequisites</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Basic knowledge of Scala</li>\n<li>An empty scala project set up with <a href=\"https://scalapb.github.io/docs/\">ScalaPB</a> and <a href=\"https://www.scala-sbt.org/\">SBT</a></li>\n<li>Basic Knowledge of <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview\">ProtoBufs</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Creating the Protobuf</h2>\n<p>Firstly, we need a proto file containing the messages and a service.

When the list is empty, the head pointer points to <strong>null</strong>.</p>\n<p>Linked lists can dynamically increase in size and it is easy to insert and delete from a linked list because unlike arrays, we only need to change the pointers of the previous element and the next element to insert or delete an element.</p>\n<p>Linked lists are typically used to create file systems, adjacency lists, and hash tables.</p>\n<h3>Types of Linked Lists</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Singly Linked List (Uni-directional)</li>\n<li>Doubly Linked List (Bi-directional)</li>\n<li>Circular Linked List</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Linked Lists are very widely used in the industry and it is also one of the most important topics which you should positively know before appearing for a technical interview. Operations on Linked Lists are fairly easy, but optimised operations are what catches the eye. In this article, we'll take a look at most of them, in their most optimised form (Linear Time Complexity at max).</p>\n<p>We're using C++ as our base language and will continue to do so for most DSA
